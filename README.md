# Deployee

> **THIS IS A COMPLETE REWRITE IN GOLANG!** 

A tool to simplify deployments using AWS auto scaling engine.

## How it works?

#### How deployments should work? 
The autoscaling engine allows us a new concept of deployment. 
Basically we promote a new version of an application. When a new instance of an AMI is created, during setup, the latest version of the promoted application is installed on this machine via script.
In this model, the concept of deployment is only renew existing machines of a group of scalability.

#### How the deployment is done (here the magic happens)
We assume that the issue of promotion and setup is already solved in the setup of AMI.
This tool helps you to renew all instances of a scale group.
There are several ways to renew instances. We call these ways of strategies. Below is a list of the available strategies. Feel the urge to create your own strategy and send us a pull request.
